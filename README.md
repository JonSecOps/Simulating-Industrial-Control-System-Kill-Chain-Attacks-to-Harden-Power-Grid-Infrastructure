# Simulating Industrial Control System Kill Chain Attacks to Harden Power Grid Infrastructure

**Project Summary:**

This project emulates the 2015 Ukraine Power Grid attacks using a virtual testbed to conduct forensic investigations, analyze traces and evidence of breaches, test the resilience of DLT nodes and OT devices, and develop forensic tools. The work focuses on identifying vulnerabilities and attack tactics to strengthen cybersecurity measures for critical infrastructure, including U.S. power systems, while gaining hands-on experience with SCADA protocols and OT devices.

**Learning Points:**
1. **ICS Vulnerabilities:** Identified common weaknesses in Industrial Control Systems.
2. **Kill Chain Analysis:** Simulated the ICS Kill Chain phases for detailed attack documentation.
3. **Tool Proficiency:** Enhanced skills with Nmap, Metasploit, and Meterpreter for network exploitation.
4. **Pivoting Techniques:** Learned lateral movement to target critical assets like HMIs.
5. **Defense Strategies:** Gained insights to improve cybersecurity for critical infrastructure.
6. **Networking Skills:** Built and managed virtual network testbeds.
7. **Documentation:** Improved attack-chain reporting and knowledge sharing.
